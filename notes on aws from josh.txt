Other things to look for on the Services page from AWS:

s3 like a google drive for your code - where to put all your static data
RDS also really helpful - where to put all your database stuff

elastic beanstalk - does all the work of spinning up the ec2, installing flask, python, etc
very helpful for shifting from a small instance to a medium one, etc.
does some version control on your app
