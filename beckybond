Re: WC Docket No. 14-28 Comments  
 
Dear Chairman Wheeler and the Commissioners of the FCC, 
 
Enclosed are 117,460 individual public comments collected by CREDO Action for 
submission to the open Internet docket. Individual comments may differ throughout, 
although the majority read as follows:  
 
“As an Internet user who believes strongly in the importance of a free and open 
Internet, I urge the FCC to reclassify broadband Internet access as a 
telecommunications service, and save Net Neutrality. 
 
In addition, the FCC should reject the proposed rules that would allow Internet 
service providers to divide the Internet into fast lanes for wealthy corporations and 
slow lanes for the rest of us.” 
 
The comments have been split into 24 documents in order to facilitate uploading to 
the FCC website. This is the first of the four submissions. 
 
Please contact me if you have any questions about the attached comment 
submissions. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Becky Bond
